# Wordle-Solver
It's not cheating if you write the code yourself ;)

## How it works:
Type as normal to fill in the guesses you've already made, and then click the individual letters to change the colors. 
When you press solve, it'll run your guesses against all of wordle's potential words (both the ones they use as answers and the ones that are just guesses).
On the right side of the screen, you'll see a list of potential words to try.
